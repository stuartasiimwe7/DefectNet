# DefectNet: AI-Powered Defect Detection System

DefectNet is an AI-driven system for detecting and classifying defects in semiconductor wafers using deep learning. This project utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision models to automate defect detection in semiconductor manufacturing, making the process more efficient and accurate.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Defect Detection**: Use of **Faster R-CNN** for identifying defects in wafer images.
- **Customizable Model**: Fine-tuning pretrained models with your own semiconductor wafer datasets.
- **API Service**: Fast and efficient **FastAPI** server for serving predictions.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Ready to be containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **AWS/GCP**.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stuartasiimwe7/DefectNet.git
cd DefectNet
